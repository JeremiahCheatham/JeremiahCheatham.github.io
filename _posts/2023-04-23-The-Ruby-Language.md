The C language was created by Dennis Ritche at Bell Labs for use with the Unix operating system. The Unix kernel was rewritten in C. Today every major commerical and open source operating systems kernel is written primarily in C. This list includes Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, IOS, BSD, Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo, Smart TVs, Smart Speakers, Smart Watches and many more.

C is a strongly typed, low-level, imperitive language. This means that variables are explicitly given a datatype when declared. Being low-level C has direct access to memory and system resources. C programs exectute code imparitively as a sequence statements.

C programs are compiled to machine code and executed directly by the CPU, which makes it a very fast and efficient language. C is often used as a benchmark for other languages, as it sets the standard for speed of execution. Other languages being 1 to 100 times slower than C is a common.

C lacks many features of modern languages such as Object Orientated Programming. Lacking classes makes larger or more complex structured code harder to manage, understand or debug. C is also missing a string type and instead uses null terminated character arrays. This makes working with strings very clums and difficult.

C is not type safe, meaning it does not check a variable is used correctly for it's type. It also doesn't do bounds checking on allocated memory or arrays. C allows direct access to memmory though pointers and has no garbage collector, for freeing memory allocated on the heap. C instead leaves this up to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation in order to avoid memory leaks and other errors.

> Dennis Ritchie originally created the B language as a simplified version of the BCPL language for the Multics operating system. He later created a successor to B with additional features and improvements called New B or NB, which was later changed to C.
