## Basics of the C Language Syntax

> Don't worry about memorizing the code in this these examples. This section is meant to familiarize you with basic syntax. Just have a good look at the style the code is written.

The basic elements of the C Language Syntax are as follows.
- Preprocessor directives
- Declarations, Initializations and Definitions
- Statements and expressions
- Comments

Lets look take a look a the famous Hello World example.
We will break it down into individual sections to see how the C Language is written.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
<br>
In the first line we see `#include`. This is what's known as a preprocessor directive. We will discuss these later but for now just know that they are not handled by the compiler. They always start with a `#`. This specific line tells the preprocessor to include the Standard IO(Input/Output) header file needed for the `printf()` function.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
```
{: .nolineno }
<br>
Line 3 is a comment. A single line comment starts with `//`. Comments can be messages explaining code or actual code that you wish to disable. Comments are ignored by the compiler.
```c
   // Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
```
{: .nolineno }
<br>
Line 4 is a function call. The function is `printf()` and it has an argument passed to it `"Hello, World!"`. The entire line ending in `;` is a statment.
```c
   printf("Hello, World!");
```
{: .nolineno }
<br>
Line 5 is a `return` statement. Again it's ending in `;`. Single line statements end in `;` just like the function call from line 4. The `return` keyword in this instance exits the main function and returns the int `0`.
```c
   return 0;
```
{: .nolineno }
<br>
The following is a function definition. `int main()` is the function header or signature. Between the `{}` is the function body. The statements and comment are part of the function body. Notice how inside the `{}` the code is indented. This is for readability of the structure of the code.
```c
int main() {
   // Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
{: .nolineno }
